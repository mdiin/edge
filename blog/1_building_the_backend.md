# The concept
- One project from back-end to front-end
- Shared view code
- Shared routing code
- Available in all browsers
  - No Javascript to full websockets
  - Progressive enhancement
- Available as an API

# Database
- Simple, in-memory `atom`-based
- Schema

# Yada resources
- How to respond to various routes
- Data-driven way of handling route responses
- Good seperation between various content types
- Spec for resource parameters

# Views
- CLJC
- Difference between Javascript-client and server:
  - Handling updates
- Building for no-Javascript
  - `input` type `submit` for any changes

# Routing
- Bidi
  - `RoutePairs` can be surprising
  - Client/server differences

# Webserver
- Not much to see here...

# Component system
- The aero configuration pattern (https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/aero.html)
- Seperates dependency specification and component instantiation
